## Coolors

This is a remake of Coolors clone website. You feel free to 
adjust a any colors like Hue, brightness and saturation, even you can record your preferred colors in localstorage so it may be able to utilize your colors again that you had backed up in storage. Currently, it is only possible to use it on laptops, but I intend to make it responsive for use on any device in the futureðŸ–¤. Stay tuned!!
